Installation
============
Once you have unpacked the package in a directory of your choice, go there and run the following:

	./configure [options] && make && make install

The following special options are available for configure:
	--enable-busmonitor			by default, eibnetmux does not support bus monitor connection requests
								by EIBnet/IP clients (such as ETS), as this may create severe problems
								for other clients.
								By specifying this option, eibnetmux allows clients to request a bus
								monitor connection, as long as no other EIBnet/IP clients are active.
								If a bus monitor connection has been established, all other clients will
								be blocked.
								eibnetmux clients are not taken into account for this functionality.
								There is no guarantee whatsoever on what happens to them if you
								turn a bus monitor on (or off).
	--enable-clientonly			do not build the eibnetmux daemon but only the client library
								specify this for systems on which you want to build a client application
								when the daemon is running somewhere else
	--enable-php				if php is installed on your system and you wish not to install the 
								php client library, specify this option
For Gentoo users:
	An ebuild is available from the downloads section of the eibnetmux project.

Requirements
============
eibnetmux requires the following libraries:

	GNU Pth - The GNU Portable Threads
		Version: 2.0.6+
		http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/

	zLogger - Logging framework for C
		Version: 1.0.5+
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/zlogger/

	eibnetmux supports user-based authentication for its special client interface
		for security reasons, it only accepts encrypted passwords
		encryption support is provided by PolarSSL
		if you don't have it installed, authentication support is disabled automatically
	PolarSSL - Small cryptographic library
		Version 0.12.0+
		http://www.polarssl.org
	XySSL - Embedded SSL
		Version 0.8+
		http://xyssl.org
		XySSL is the predecessor of PolarSSL. It is no longer maintained so it is strongly
		recommended to switch to PolarSSL.

		If you can't find them on their original web sites anymore, a copy is available from the
		eibnetmux files section on Sourceforge.
