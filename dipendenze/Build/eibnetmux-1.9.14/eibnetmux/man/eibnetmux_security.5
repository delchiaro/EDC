.SH NAME
eibnetmux_security \- Security definitions for the EIBnet/IP multiplexer.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This file is a plain ASCII file, defining the security rules for
.BR eibnetmux (1).
It is made up of several sections, each addressing another aspect.

.SH SECTIONS
The following sections are available:

.PD 0
.TP
.B [eibnetip]
.TP
.B [clients]
.PD
Define which clients are allowed to connect to
.B eibnetmux
using the EIBnet/IP or eibnetmux socket protocol, respectively.
This can be used to limit, for example, ETS access to specific workstations and or subnets.

Lines in these sections have the following format:
.RS 14
type: address/mask
.RE
.RS 7
where \fItype\fR can be:
.RS 7
.PD 0
.TP
allow
permits unrestricted access
.TP
deny
all accesses refused
.TP
read
allows only read requests
.TP
write
allows only write requests
.RE

The source address of any incoming request is first bitwise 'and' to the \fImask\fR, then compared to the \fIaddress\fR.
If a match is found, the appropriate action is taken and the search is terminated.

The order of the definitions is important.
.RE

.TP
.B [authorisations]
Setup access level for authenticated users (only for eibnetmux socket clients).

Lines in this section have the following format:
.RS 7
.RS 7
level: function [, function] ...
.RE
where \fIlevel\fR is a positive integer. Level 0 is used for anonymous access, by default it allows 'none'.

Functions can be:
.RS 7
.PD 0
.TP 16
read
read data from bus
.TP 16
write
set value of group on bus
.TP 16
monitor
monitor all requests sent to groups
.TP 16
mgmt_client
connect/disconnect eibnet/ip client
.TP 16
mgmt_status
get status
.TP 16
mgmt_loglevel
set log level
.TP 16
all
all functions
.TP 16
bus_all
all bus accessing funcions, no management
.TP 16
mgmt_all
all management functionality
.TP 16
none
no access allowed
.RE
.RE

.TP
.B [users]
Define the list of users which can authenticate to
.BR eibnetmux .

Note that if no users are defined, all access will be anonymous and subject to the authorisations of level 0.
If level 0 has not been setup in section \fB[Authorisations]\fR, it defaults to 'no access'.

Lines in this section have the following format:
.RS 7
.RS 7
name: [level] password-hash
.RE
where \fIname\fR is the user's name. Please note that it is limited to 64 characters and cannot include spaces.
\fIlevel\fR is a positive integer and references the levels in section \fB[Authorisations]\fR. If it is missing, level 0 is assumed.
The \fIpassword-hash\fR can be calculated with \fBeibnetmux_hash\fR(1).
.RE

.TP
.B [dhm]
This section is used to specify the parameters for the Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange.
If it is missing, authentication requests need to be transmitted in the clear.
If it is specified, the requests can be encrypted, thwarting any eavesdropper attacks.

There are two ways to define the parameters:
.RS 7
.RS 7
file: path
.RE
or
.RS 7
P: prime
.br
G: generator
.RE

The latter is just a copy of the contents of the file. If both are specified, the file takes precedence and overwrites
the values in the security file.

The values can be calculated using \fBeibnetmux_dhm\fR(1).
