 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * For latest information please visit
 * http://eibnetmux.sourceforge.net
 *
 * EIBnetmux is an open source software project for domotic control.
 *
 * EIBnetmux extends the IP-reach of the KNX bus and adds support for multiple concurrent clients
 * to the standard IP Interface N148/21.
 *
 * In addition to the standard EIBnet/IP protocol, it features a very simple,
 * TCP/IP socket-based protocol which allows applications to easily retrieve and set data from/on the bus.
 * This empowers developers to focus on their applications and implement these great and long-wished for
 * features without having to implement the rather complex, not very well documented, timing critical,
 * UDP-based EIBnet/IP protocol.
 *
 * This document is intended as a programmer's reference to the
 * EIBnetmux C API. It has been generated from the source
 * code by <a href="http://www.doxygen.org" target="_blank">Doxygen</a>, a great tool created by Dimitri van Heesch.
