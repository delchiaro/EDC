.TH ENMX_MONITOR 3  2008-02-10 "" "eibnetmux Client Library"
.SH NAME
enmx_monitor \- monitor packets sent to KNX groups
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <enmx_lib.h>
.sp
.BI "unsigned char * enmx_monitor( ENMX_HANDLE " "handle, " "uint16_t " "mask, " "unsigned char *" "buf, " "uint16_t *" "buflen, " "uint16_t *" "length " );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR enmx_monitor ()
function instructs eibnetmux to return the next request addressed
to any of the KNX groups in \fImask\fP.

\fIhandle\fP is a connection handle previously returned by
.BR enmx_open (3).
The connection must not have been used with any other call
of the eibnetmux library other than
.BR enmx_monitor ().

The address of the requested groups is encoded in \fIknxaddress\fP
in the form
.BR "0mmm msss gggg gggg" .
A request is returned if the bit-wise AND of the target group address
and the mask is not 0. The bits are encoded as follows:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.BR m " - main group"
.TP
.BR s " - sub group"
.TP
.BR g " - group"
.PD
.RE
\fIbuf\fP is a pointer to a pre-allocated buffer which will receive the 
data transmitted on the bus. Its current length is specified in the
value pointed to by \fIbuflen\fP. If the buffer is too small to hold all
data, it is enlarged and the value pointed to by \fIbuflen\fP is updated
with the new size.

In any case, \fIlength\fP points to a variable which will receive the size
of the returned data (which may be less than the buffer size).

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR enmx_monitor ()
returns a pointer to the received data or NULL upon error.
Unlike 
.BR enmx_read (3),
the buffer contains the full EIB frame including sender and receiver
addresses and the data as received from the bus with no interpretation performed.
To use the data, the calling function must know the format of the EIB frame and
the EIS type of the addressed group and convert the data accordingly.

In case of an error, use
.BR enmx_geterror (3)
to retrieve the error cause.

.SH "ERRORS"
.TP
.B ENMX_COMMUNICATION
Error when communicating with eibnetmux.
.TP
.B E_SERVER_ABORTED
Server closed connection
.TP
.B E_UNKNOWN_GROUP
Unknown group
.TP
.B E_INTERNAL
Internal error
.TP
.B E_NO_MEMORY
Out of memory
.TP
.B E_TIMEOUT
Timeout while sending/receiving
.TP
.B E_WRONG_USAGE
Connection was already used for different command
.TP
.B E_NO_CONNECTION
Invalid connection handle

.SH "EIB FRAME"
The EIB frame returned by
.BR enmx_monitor (
is defined as follows:

struct __attribute__((packed)) {
        uint8_t  code;
        uint8_t  zero;
        uint8_t  ctrl;
        uint8_t  ntwrk;
        uint16_t saddr;              // source address
        uint16_t daddr;              // destination address
        uint8_t  length;
        uint8_t  tpci;
        uint8_t  apci;
        uint8_t  data[16];
};

.SH NOTES
You are responsible to free the result buffer returned by
.BR enmx_monitor ().
