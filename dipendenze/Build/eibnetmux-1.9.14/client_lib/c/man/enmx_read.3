.SH NAME
enmx_read \- read the value of a KNX group from eibnetmux
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <enmx_lib.h>
.sp
.BI "unsigned char * enmx_read( ENMX_HANDLE " "handle, " "uint16_t " "knxaddress, " "uint16_t *" "length " );

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR enmx_read ()
function retrieves the value of a KNX group from the bus.
\fIhandle\fP is a connection handle previously returned by
.BR enmx_open (3).
The connection must not have been used with any other call
of the eibnetmux library other than
.BR enmx_read ().

The address of the requested group is encoded in \fIknxaddress\fP
in the form
.B 0mmm msss gggg gggg
where
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.BR m " - main group"
.TP
.BR s " - sub group"
.TP
.BR g " - group"
.PD
.RE
\fIlength\fP will receive the size of the returned data.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR enmx_read ()
returns a pointer to the received data or NULL upon error. The buffer is allocated
from the heap and must be freed by the caller when it is no longer used.
The data is returned as received from the bus with no interpretation performed.
To use the data, the calling function must know the EIS type of the group
and convert the data accordingly.

In case of an error, use
.BR enmx_geterror (3)
to retrieve the error cause.
