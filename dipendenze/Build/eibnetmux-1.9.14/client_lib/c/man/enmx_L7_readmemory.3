.SH NAME
enmx_L7_readmemory \- read a remote KNX device's memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <enmx_lib.h>
.sp
.BI "int enmx_L7_readmemory( ENMX_HANDLE " "handle, " "uint16_t " "knxaddress, " "uint16_t " "offset, " "uint16_t " length, " "unsigned char " "*buf" );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR enmx_L7_readmemory ()
function reads the memory of a remote KNX device
and returns it in \fIbuf\fP. The parameters \fIoffset\fP
and \fIlength\fP define where to start the reading and
how many bytes to return.

\fIhandle\fP is a connection handle previously returned by
.BR enmx_open (3).
The connection must not have been used with any other call
of the eibnetmux library except any other layer 7 API calls.

The address of the targeted device is encoded in \fIknxaddress\fP
in the form
.B llll aaaa dddd dddd
where

.BR l " - line"

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR enmx_L7_readmemory ()
returns the number of bytes read from the remote KNX device,
-255 if \fIhandle\fP is invalid, or -1 on any other failure.
Upon some failures, the number of bytes returned may be less
than requested by \fIlength\fP.
Use
.BR enmx_geterror (3)
to retrieve the error cause.
