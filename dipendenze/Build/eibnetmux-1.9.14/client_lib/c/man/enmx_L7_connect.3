.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR enmx_L7_connect ()
function establishes a connection with a remote KNX device.
Such connections can be used to interact directly with the
physical device, not the logical groups.
Possible operations are, for example, reading a device's memory
or resetting it.

\fIhandle\fP is a connection handle previously returned by
.BR enmx_open (3).
The connection must not have been used with any other call
of the eibnetmux library.

The address of the targeted device is encoded in \fIknxaddress\fP
in the form
.B llll aaaa dddd dddd
where
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.BR l " - line"
.TP
.BR a " - area"
.TP
.BR d " - device"
.PD
.RE

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR enmx_L7_connect ()
returns a 0 on success, -255 if \fIhandle\fP is invalid, or -1 on any other failure.
Use
.BR enmx_geterror (3)
to retrieve the error cause.
