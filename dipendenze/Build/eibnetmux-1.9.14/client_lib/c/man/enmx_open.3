.TH ENMX_OPEN 3  2008-06-17 "" "eibnetmux Client Library"
.SH NAME
enmx_open \- open a socket connection to eibnetmux
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <enmx_lib.h>
.sp
.BI "ENMX_HANDLE enmx_open( char *" "hostname, " "char *" "myname " );
.sp
.BI "ENMX_HANDLE enmx_pth_open( char *" "hostname, " "char *" "myname " );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR enmx_open ()
function opens a connection to an eibnetmux server and returns
a connection handle. The value of \fImyname\fP is used as a client identifier.

In simple installations, where there is exactly one eibnetmux server,
\fIhostname\fP may be passed as NULL and the library will search for the server.
If the server cannot be found or more than one reply to the search request,
\fBenmx_open\fP() returns with an error.

If the application uses GNU Pth for (non-preemptive) threading, tell the eibnetmux
C client library to internally use the appropriate pth_ calls for networking.
If a call blocks, for example because it has to wait for a reply from the server,
only the current Pth thread is blocked. If standard Unix networking calls were used,
the complete process is blocked, including all other Pth threads. To establish 
a Pth-enabled connection to the server, use
.BR enmx_pth_open ().

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.BR enmx_open ()
and
.BR enmx_pth_open ()
functions return a connection handle. On error, a negative number is returned:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B -1
Problem allocating resources: out of memory, etc.
.TP
.B -2
Host unknown.
.TP
.B -3
Unable to establish connection: eibnetmux not running on host, etc.
.TP
.B -4
Unable to register client name with server.
.TP
.B -5
Library not initialised. Call
.BR enmx_init ().
.TP
.B -6
Either none or more than one eibnetmux server found. Specify target host.
.TP
.B -7
The client identifier \fImyname\fP must be specified.

.SH BUGS
The threaded version of the library still uses the standard, not thread-safe
and blocking
.BR gethostbyname (3).
