Installation
============
Once you have unpacked the package in a directory of your choice, go there and run the following:

	./configure [options] && make && make install

The following special options are available for configure:
	--with-plugins			    zLogger's functionality can be extended with plugins. Third parties can
								develop new appenders or format handlers.
								With this option you can first, activate building of the included plugins,
								and second, specify the location where the plugins are installed.
								By default, plugins are built and the target directory is
								/usr/lib/zlogger/plugins/<version>
	--disable-pth-plugins		zLogger ships with a small set of plugins. Some of them re-implement the
								same functionality as some of the built-in appenders but with a twist.
								Instead of calling standard system functions they integrate with PTH,
								The GNU Portable Threads (see http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/).
								If PTH is not installed on the system, these plugins are not built.
								If PTH is installed but you do not want the plugins, the use this option
								to suppress their building.

If you want to compile the samples. You need to have zLogger installed for this to work.

	cd samples
	./configure && make

For Gentoo users:
	An ebuild is available from the downloads section of the zLogger project.
