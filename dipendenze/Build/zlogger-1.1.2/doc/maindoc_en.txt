 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * For latest information please visit
 * http://zlogger.sourceforge.net
 *
 * zLogger is simple & efficient logging library for C with support for multiple appenders/formats,
 * including ring buffer for debug messages.
 *
 * There are three basic objects in zLogger:
 * 	logger		Specifies which messages are logged to which destination.
 * 				An application may have more than one logger.
 * 	format		Specifies the final layout of the log message.
 * 				Can include various information such as current date/time,
 * 				the message id, the logger's name, and the message itself.
 * 	appender	Sends a log message to a specific destination.
 * 				There are appenders for log files, syslog, UDP receivers.
 * 				Additional appenders can easily be included as plugins.
 *
 * This document is intended as a programmer's reference to the
 * zLogger C API. It has been generated from the source
 * code by <a href="http://www.doxygen.org" target="_blank">Doxygen</a>, a great tool created by Dimitri van Heesch.
